# Certification_Verification
# OBJECTIVE :
The objective of this project is to develop a web application for certificate verification, which allows users to verify intern information based on certification ID or intern ID. Additionally, the application provides functionality to add new intern information and delete existing intern information.
# KEY FEATURES: 
1. Verification by Certification ID: 
Users can enter a certification ID to verify intern information associated with that ID. If the information is found, it is displayed to the user. 
2. Verification by Intern ID: 
Users can input an intern ID to verify the corresponding intern information. If the information exists, it is displayed to the user. 
3. Add Intern Information: 
Users can add new intern information by providing details such as certification ID, intern ID, name, join date, department, and email ID. Upon adding the information, it is displayed for 
verification and saved in the data repository. 
4. Delete Intern Information: 
Users can delete existing intern information by specifying the intern ID to be deleted. After deletion, the application verifies if the information has been successfully removed from the 
data repository. 
5 Download Updated CSV: 
Users can download the updated intern data in CSV format after performing add or delete operations.
